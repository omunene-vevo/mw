        ABOUT ME
      </h3>
         

      <p>Waiswa Emmanuel who is widely known as Dr. Miracle MW was born on the 23th of December, 1998 in Wandegeya village, Mayuge District.
        <br> 
        He went to Wandegeya primary school, St. Mary's primary school and Nakawa primary school for his primary education.
        After primary the situation worsened and he was unable to go on with education due to various challenges that he met like loss of school fees and other family issues.
       Right now, he is married to one wife called Nabakooza Josephine since 2021 and so far God has blessed them with one child called Kisakye Apophia Miracle.
       <br>Miracle was born by a man called Haman Musaana and Mutesi Regina and he joined the music industry in 2016
      </br>
      <br>
        <h4>Music Journey</h4>
        Dr. Miracle loved music since childhood and before he got saved. He would attend many village night dances. He even attended many artists performances at the time. He really was inspired by these musicians. Then he started writing secular music which unfortunately was not recorded due lack of funds. One day, as he was growing and was now eighteen years. He got saved and when he entered churdh music became easier for him because church always gave him opportunity to minister in music. he wrote a song in 2016 which was not recorded but it had now made him realise that he can write gospel music as well. When he got saved, he decided to venture into dancing and singing for the the Lord.</p></div>
